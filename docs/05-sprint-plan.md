## 1. Overview

This document is both a roadmap (where the product is going) and a sprint plan
(how each increment gets built). It is deliberately a "retroactive plus forward"
plan. Sprint S0 does not propose new work: it documents the engines and schema
already shipped in v1 (`els911-portal`) as the inherited baseline that later
sprints port forward. Sprints S1 through S7 are the forward build of v2
(Pathfinder), a SvelteKit rewrite of the application shell that ports v1's
proven imperative engines rather than rewriting them.

A roadmap is most useful when it shows progress, not just deadlines. Framing
S0 as Complete (inherited) and S1-S7 as Planned is the honest version of that:
the foundation is real and demonstrable today, and the plan from here is
sequenced to de-risk the hardest work early.

### Methodology

- **Agile, two-week sprints.** Each sprint closes with a client-facing review
  and a team retrospective.
- **TDD-gated per epic E14.** Every acceptance criterion (AC) is proven by a
  failing test first (Vitest for engine and unit logic, Playwright for end-to-end
  flows and screenshot capture). No story is Done until its ACs pass and a
  Playwright screenshot is captured. Tests are written before implementation.
- **De-risking principle: shell rewrite, engine port.** The shell (auth,
  routing, dashboards, CRUD, state) is rewritten in SvelteKit. The imperative
  engines (2D annotation, map/NFPA export, 3D splat viewer) are extracted as
  framework-agnostic TypeScript modules mounted in thin Svelte wrappers. This
  is why the engine-port sprint (S3) ships early and why each engine gets its
  own unit tests as it is extracted.

### Now / Next / Later framing

- **Now (S0-S2):** the inherited baseline plus the v2 foundation - scaffold,
  brand layer, auth, hierarchy. This is the standing-up phase.
- **Next (S3-S5):** the core value engines - the 2D annotation and NFPA export
  port, the scan library, and the new 3D splat viewer.
- **Later (S6-S7):** the cross-cutting maturity work - global search,
  collaboration, compliance, accessibility, data migration, and launch.

### How sprints map to epics

Each sprint pulls one or more canonical epics (E1-E14) and delivers vertical
slices of them. The traceability chain is Epic -> User Story (US) -> Acceptance
Criterion (AC) -> Test (T) -> Sprint (S), defined in the canonical context.
E14 (Quality and Delivery Harness) is not a single sprint; it is established in
S1 and runs continuously through every sprint thereafter.

## 3. Capacity and cadence assumptions

These are stated as assumptions and should be revisited at each retrospective.

- **Team size:** solo or small team (one to three engineers). Velocity figures
  below are illustrative, not committed; they exist to size sprints relative to
  each other, not to promise a date.
- **Cadence:** two-week sprints, start mid-June 2026. One client review and one
  retrospective per sprint.
- **TDD discipline:** tests are written before implementation. This front-loads
  cost in each sprint and is the reason engine-heavy sprints (S3, S5) are not
  also asked to carry large new surface area.
- **Continuous overhead:** roughly 15-20 percent of each sprint is reserved for
  the cross-sprint workstreams in Section 6 (CI, accessibility passes, security
  review, documentation). This is not free time; it is planned.
- **Deploy target:** every sprint deploys to `pathfinder.pages.dev` via
  `wrangler pages deploy` (direct push; git push does not publish). The test
  project is isolated from els911-portal production.
- **Definition of velocity here:** "one vertical slice" means a story whose ACs
  pass end to end, including UI, server route, and persistence, with a captured
  Playwright screenshot. Sprints are sized at three to six such slices.

---

## 4. Sprint detail

Each sprint below follows the same shape: goal, scope, task breakdown,
Definition of Done, demo/acceptance, and dependencies/risks.

The Definition of Done is identical in spirit for every sprint and is stated
once here, then referenced. A sprint is Done when, for every in-scope story:

- All acceptance criteria (ACs) for in-scope stories pass.
- Playwright screenshots are captured for the delivered flows.
- The build deploys clean to `pathfinder.pages.dev`.
- No secrets and no real client data are committed (the repo is public).
- The AGENTS.md rules are honored (boundaries, commands, ASCII-only commit
  messages, target/ directories moved out before deploy).

Per-sprint sections restate the DoD with the sprint-specific additions.

---

### S0 - Baseline (retroactive). Status: Complete (inherited)

**Sprint goal.** Document what v1 (`els911-portal`) already delivers, so that
the forward plan treats it as a known, tested foundation rather than greenfield.

**Scope (already delivered in v1).** This sprint is a record, not a plan. v1
ships, today, the following, which S3 and S6 port forward into Svelte wrappers:

- **2D PDF.js annotation engine** (`viewer.js`, ~196KB). PDF.js rendering with
  zoom, pan, and multi-page navigation, plus a canvas overlay supporting 12
  annotation tool types: circle, rectangle, arrow, freehand, comment,
  correction, and the six safety markers AED, stairs, door, overhead, exit, and
  fire extinguisher. Full keyboard shortcut map (S/C/R/A/F/T/X/E, digits 1-6 for
  markers, Space to pan, arrows to page, Ctrl+Z/Y/S, Delete, +/- zoom). Undo and
  redo. Annotation coordinates are stored normalized to [0,1] of page
  dimensions, which makes them resolution-independent and portable.
- **Map markers layer.** A persistent mapping layer (`map_markers`) separate
  from review annotations: stairs, hallway, door, and elevator types, with
  pinned and manually repositioned labels, hallway polygons (JSON point arrays),
  and secondary label pins.
- **NFPA-style legend plus autofit.** Auto-generated standardized legend with
  marker placement and label autofit logic (the fiddly correctness - placement,
  legend autofit, jitter avoidance - that the canonical de-risking principle
  explicitly says not to re-litigate).
- **Multi-page print export.** Per-page crop boundaries (`map_crops`) with page
  labels and an explicit `print_order` for ordering multi-page printed exports.
- **Projects, users, and roles.** Projects with status (pending, in_review,
  approved, completed, archived) and progress (0-100); facility, district, zip,
  address, and phone fields used on map exports; project members with reviewer
  and viewer roles. Users with admin/staff/client roles. JWT auth (HS256 via Web
  Crypto) plus API keys (stored as SHA-256 hashes). PBKDF2-SHA256 password
  hashing at 100,000 iterations. Server-side RBAC on every request; clients see
  only projects they are members of.
- **D1 schema.** The full v1 schema: `users`, `projects`, `project_members`,
  `documents`, `annotations`, `project_notes`, `annotation_comments`,
  `map_markers`, `map_crops`, `api_keys`, `activity_log`, `audit_log`. v2
  retains all of these additively and layers the hierarchy and media tables on
  top (see canonical context Section 8).
- **REST API and admin panel.** Full CRUD for projects, documents, annotations,
  users, and API keys; JSON annotation export (schema 1.0); admin user
  management, API key management, permission matrix, and audit log viewer.

**Task breakdown.** None - work is complete. The S0 deliverable is this written
baseline and the mapping of v1 capabilities to the v2 epics they feed (E5, E6,
E4, E2).

**Definition of Done.** Met historically in v1. For the purposes of this plan,
S0 is Done because the engines are demonstrably running in `els911-portal` and
their behaviors are catalogued above and in the v1 README and `schema.sql`.

**Demo / acceptance.** Show the live v1 portal: open a floorplan, place the 12
tool types, add map markers, generate the NFPA-style legend, and produce a
multi-page print export. This is the "what working looks like" reference that
the forward sprints must preserve through the port.

**Dependencies and risks.** The principal risk that S0 introduces into the
forward plan is regression during the port (addressed in S3): v1 logic is
battle-tested but undertested in the unit sense, so extracting it must come with
new characterization tests that lock current behavior before refactoring.

### S1 - Foundation. Status: Planned

**Sprint goal.** Stand up the v2 SvelteKit shell on Cloudflare with the
white-label brand layer, the ported auth, and the test/CI harness in place.

**Scope.** E1 (White-Label Brand Layer), E2 (Identity, Roles and Access), E14
(Quality and Delivery Harness). Vertical slices: a user can load the app under
the Pathfinder default brand, switch to the ELS911 profile by build env, log in
with JWT, and have every gate enforced server-side.

**Task breakdown.**

- Scaffold SvelteKit (Svelte 5) with `@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare`; configure
  Pages plus Functions; wire D1 (`DB`), R2 (`DOCUMENTS`), and KV (`CACHE`)
  bindings.
- Build the brand-profile system: `brand/<id>/brand.config.ts` plus logo,
  logoMark, favicon assets; flow color tokens, typography, support contacts, and
  legal footer to CSS custom properties at load. No hard-coded brand colors in
  components.
- Author two profiles: Pathfinder LiDAR (default) and ELS911 (ready-made).
  Build-time resolution via `BRAND=els911` env.
- Port JWT (HS256, Web Crypto) auth and API-key verification from v1 as
  TypeScript modules behind `+server.ts` routes; port PBKDF2-SHA256 hashing.
- Implement RBAC middleware (admin/staff/client) enforced on every server route.
- Stand up E14: Vitest config, Playwright config with screenshot capture, a
  thin CI workflow, and the `wrangler pages deploy` path to `pathfinder.pages.dev`.
- Author AGENTS.md (commands with flags; Always/Ask-first/Never boundaries with
  "never commit secrets"; flat project map with versions; test and git workflow;
  ASCII-only commit messages; move target/ dirs out before deploy).

**Definition of Done.** Standard DoD (Section 4) plus: brand swap works by env
with zero component edits; login and RBAC ACs pass; AGENTS.md committed and
under ~150 lines.

**Demo / acceptance.** Load the app as Pathfinder, redeploy as ELS911 and show
the same UI reskinned by one profile swap; log in as admin/staff/client and show
a route blocked for the wrong role; show a green CI run with a captured
screenshot.

**Dependencies and risks.** No upstream dependency (this is the root sprint).
Risk: brand-token plumbing that leaks a hard-coded color undermines E1 - mitigate
with a lint/test that fails on literal hex in components. Risk: auth port subtly
diverging from v1 - mitigate by porting the exact HS256/PBKDF2 parameters and
testing against known v1 tokens.

---

### S2 - Hierarchy. Status: Planned

**Sprint goal.** Add the multi-tenant org hierarchy and roll-up dashboards that
become the navigational backbone for everything that follows.

**Scope.** E3 (Org Hierarchy and Dashboards). Vertical slices: model
Org -> District -> Facility -> Building; render roll-up dashboards; provide
breadcrumb switchers that double as sibling dropdowns; expose org-scoped data
isolation that later auth checks rely on.

**Task breakdown.**

- Add `orgs`, `districts`, `facilities`, `buildings` tables; add
  `projects.building_id` FK; write migrations additive over the retained v1
  schema.
- Build CRUD and org-scoped read paths for each hierarchy level; enforce tenant
  isolation in the RBAC layer from S1.
- Build roll-up dashboards (counts and status by level) with deliberate empty
  states (show a sample facility / preview of a completed map and one clear
  first action, per the UX research).
- Implement vertical sidebar primary nav (reserve top bar for few sections) and
  location-based breadcrumbs capped at three levels; make breadcrumb segments
  double as dropdown switchers to sibling nodes.
- Lay search-ready nav hooks (entity ids and labels) that S6 FTS5 will index.

**Definition of Done.** Standard DoD plus: hierarchy CRUD ACs pass; tenant
isolation test proves a client in one org cannot read another org's tree;
breadcrumb switcher and empty states captured in Playwright.

**Demo / acceptance.** Navigate Org -> District -> Facility -> Building, switch
siblings from a breadcrumb, view a roll-up dashboard, and show a designed empty
state for a brand-new facility.

**Dependencies and risks.** Depends on S1 (auth, bindings, brand). Risk: menu
sprawl and over-nesting - mitigate with the three-level cap and search-centric
nav. Risk: tenant isolation gaps - mitigate with explicit cross-tenant negative
tests.

---

### S3 - Engine port. Status: Planned

**Sprint goal.** Port v1's 2D annotation engine and map/NFPA export engine into
framework-agnostic TypeScript modules mounted in thin Svelte wrappers, with no
behavioral regressions.

**Scope.** E5 (2D Floorplan Annotation Engine), E6 (Safety Mapping and NFPA
Export). Vertical slices: open a PDF floorplan in v2, use all 12 tools, place map
markers, generate the NFPA-style legend with autofit, and produce a multi-page
print export - matching v1 behavior.

**Task breakdown.**

- Extract `viewer.js` into a typed `annotation-engine` module: PDF.js (pinned)
  render, canvas overlay, the 12 tool types, normalized [0,1] coordinates, undo/
  redo, keyboard map. Write characterization unit tests that lock v1 behavior
  before any refactor.
- Build a thin Svelte wrapper hosting the engine canvas; wire it to D1
  `annotations` via `+server.ts` routes; preserve the JSON export (schema 1.0).
- Extract the map/NFPA export engine: marker placement, hallway polygons,
  legend autofit, multi-page print ordering (`map_markers`, `map_crops`).
- Port NFPA-style vertical legend rendering and per-page crop/print-order export
  to PDF; unit-test autofit and ordering against v1 outputs.
- Wire engines into the S2 hierarchy (documents under buildings/facilities).

**Definition of Done.** Standard DoD plus: all 12 tool ACs pass; engine unit
tests (extracted per de-risking principle) pass; a v2 export visually matches the
v1 reference export; Playwright captures the viewer with markers and the
generated legend.

**Demo / acceptance.** Side-by-side with the S0 v1 reference: same floorplan,
same annotations, same legend and multi-page export, now running inside the v2
Svelte shell.

**Dependencies and risks.** Depends on S1 (shell) and S2 (where documents live).
Primary risk: 2D engine port regressions (this is the single biggest technical
risk in the plan) - mitigate with characterization tests written first, a pinned
PDF.js version, and the explicit rule not to re-litigate working canvas/print
logic. Risk: PDF.js version drift breaking render - mitigate by pinning.

---

### S4 - Scan library. Status: Planned

**Sprint goal.** Introduce the unified media model and reliable large-file
upload so 3D scans, walkthroughs, and reference media have a home before the
viewer is built.

**Scope.** E7 (Unified Scan Library and Media). Vertical slices: model
`media_assets` superseding flat `documents.doc_type`; perform R2 multipart
uploads of large files; archive master point clouds to a cold tier.

**Task breakdown.**

- Add `media_assets` (types: floorplan_pdf, point_cloud, splat,
  walkthrough_video, reference_image) with `version`, `r2_key`, `storage_tier`
  (hot/cold), `capture_date`, `surveyor`. Migrate v1 `documents` semantics into
  it additively.
- Implement R2 multipart upload (initiate / part URLs / complete) for large
  files (point clouds 100-300MB, walkthrough mp4 20-100MB); resumable and
  size-validated client side.
- Implement the cold-archive policy: master PLY stored in a separate cold prefix
  and never served; delivered formats (SPZ, mp4) on the hot tier.
- Build the library UI: list and version media per building/facility with
  capture date and surveyor (field-verification metadata per competitive
  research).
- Validate uploads (type, size, before-read checks consistent with image-handling
  rules) and write failure-path tests.

**Definition of Done.** Standard DoD plus: multipart upload ACs pass including a
large-file and an interrupted-upload case; storage-tier routing test proves PLY
lands cold and SPZ/mp4 land hot; no real client scan data committed.

**Demo / acceptance.** Upload a multi-hundred-MB file via multipart, show it
versioned in the library with capture date and surveyor, and show the master
archived cold while the delivery asset stays hot.

**Dependencies and risks.** Depends on S2 (where media attaches) and S1 (R2
binding). Primary risk: large-file upload reliability - mitigate with multipart,
resumability, and explicit interruption tests. Risk: storage-tier misrouting
inflating egress - mitigate with a routing test.

---

### S5 - 3D viewer. Status: Planned

**Sprint goal.** Ship the new browser 3D scan viewer: the zero-friction mp4
baseline plus the interactive Spark splat viewer with measurement and 3D markers.

**Scope.** E8 (3D Scan Viewer). Vertical slices: play the mp4 walkthrough; load
an SPZ splat in Spark; measure point-to-point; place anchored 3D markers; switch
floors; save named viewpoints; compare scan versions.

**Task breakdown.**

- Build the mp4 walkthrough player first (zero-friction baseline every responder
  can use; ship before the splat work).
- Integrate Spark (THREE.js, WebGL2) splat viewer; load SPZ (delivery format;
  master PLY never served); orbit, fly, and walk camera modes.
- Build the measurement tool (point-to-point distance, room dimensions) using
  Spark raycast-into-splat - a differentiator absent from off-the-shelf viewers.
- Add `scan_markers_3d` (position, normal, viewpoint, type, label, description);
  anchor markers in the scene; cap ~25 per scene as the sane default.
- Add `viewpoints` (named camera bookmarks: position, target, FOV) with smooth
  transitions; doubles as a guided key-points tour.
- Add per-floor scan switching and capture-date-labeled scan-version comparison.
- Screenshot/export for briefings.

**Definition of Done.** Standard DoD plus: SPZ loads and renders on a WebGL2
target; measurement ACs pass within tolerance; 3D marker persistence ACs pass;
mp4 and splat viewer both captured in Playwright; performance sanity-checked on a
field-representative device profile.

**Demo / acceptance.** Play an mp4 walkthrough, then load the same space as an
interactive splat, measure a doorway, drop an AED marker with a saved viewpoint,
switch floors, and compare two capture dates.

**Dependencies and risks.** Depends on S4 (media model and SPZ delivery).
Primary risk: splat performance on field devices - mitigate by targeting WebGL2
(not WebGPU), shipping SPZ (~90 percent smaller than PLY), using Spark 2.0
streaming LOD, and never serving raw PLY (which fails above ~200MB on iPhone
Safari). Risk: measurement accuracy - mitigate with tolerance-based tests.

---

### S6 - Search and collaboration. Status: Planned

**Sprint goal.** Make the portal findable and collaborative: global FTS5 search,
batch map export, and the anchored comment / resolve / mention / notify loop.

**Scope.** E10 (Global Search), E6 (Safety Mapping and NFPA Export - batch
export), E9 (Collaboration). Vertical slices: search across all entity types;
queue and produce a batch map PDF export; place an anchored comment that mentions
a teammate and triggers a batched email with a deep link; resolve a thread
without deleting it.

**Task breakdown.**

- Build the `search_index` FTS5 virtual table across facilities, buildings,
  projects, documents, and marker labels; index on write; expose a search UI
  wired to the S2 nav hooks.
- Add `export_jobs` (queued/tracked batch PDF map exports); build the batch
  export pipeline over the S3 map engine; show job status.
- Build anchored comment threads (on a map region or document area) with nested
  replies, building on v1 `annotation_comments`.
- Build the resolve workflow: resolve action hides (does not delete) resolved
  threads, preserving the audit trail.
- Add @-mentions that trigger targeted email notifications with deep links;
  batch notifications to avoid notification fatigue; add an activity feed and
  share links for outside stakeholders.

**Definition of Done.** Standard DoD plus: search returns ranked results across
all five entity types; batch export job completes and the PDF matches the S3
single-export look; comment/resolve/mention/notify ACs pass; resolved comments
are hidden not deleted (audit-trail test); notification batching verified.

**Demo / acceptance.** Search "Lincoln" and jump to the building; queue a batch
export of every building in a district; place a pin comment, @-mention a
teammate, show the batched email with a deep link, then resolve the thread and
show it preserved in history.

**Dependencies and risks.** Depends on S2 (entities to index), S3 (map engine
for batch export), and S4/S5 (media as search targets). Risk: ungoverned
notification volume - mitigate with batching. Risk: FTS5 index drift - mitigate
with index-on-write and a reindex path.

### S7 - Compliance, accessibility, migration and launch. Status: Planned

**Sprint goal.** Reach procurement-grade: NG911/NENA export, immutable audit,
WCAG 2.1 AA, admin/platform ops, the v1->v2 data migration, and launch.

**Scope.** E11 (Compliance and Trust), E12 (Accessibility), E13 (Admin and
Platform Ops). Vertical slices: export NENA-aligned GIS with z-axis floor
labels; immutable exportable audit logs; WCAG 2.1 AA across the app with non-
visual map alternatives and a VPAT; admin tooling and observability; migrate v1
data into v2; production launch.

**Task breakdown.**

- Add `compliance_meta` (per-facility last-reviewed date, last responder tour,
  mandate flags for Alyssa's/Kari's/state, drill links, z-axis floor labels).
- Build NG911 export: GeoJSON to NENA-STA-006 schema with z-axis/floor labels
  per NENA-REQ-003 dispatchable location and a confidence field; build a trust
  page and surface compliance metadata.
- Harden audit: immutable, exportable audit logs (who viewed/edited/exported
  which map, when), building on v1 `audit_log` and `activity_log`.
- Accessibility pass to WCAG 2.1 AA (target 2.2 AA forward): keyboard nav,
  screen-reader labels on symbols and exports, contrast, and non-visual map
  alternatives (text room/exit lists). Produce a VPAT/ACR.
- Build admin and platform ops: user management, API keys, audit viewer,
  settings, and observability.
- Write and rehearse the v1->v2 data migration (users, projects, members,
  documents into media_assets, annotations, map markers/crops, comments, logs);
  dry-run against a copy; verify row counts and referential integrity.
- Production launch checklist and deploy.

**Definition of Done.** Standard DoD plus: NG911 export validates against the
STA-006 schema with z-axis labels; audit export ACs pass and logs prove
immutable; WCAG 2.1 AA automated and manual checks pass with a VPAT produced;
migration dry-run reconciles row counts and FKs with zero orphans.

**Demo / acceptance.** Export a facility as NENA GeoJSON with floor labels; show
an immutable audit export; run a screen reader through a map and read the
non-visual exit list; show the admin audit viewer; demo the migration dry-run
reconciliation report.

**Dependencies and risks.** Depends on all prior sprints. Primary risks:
compliance/accessibility gaps (any one is procurement-disqualifying for gov/edu -
mitigate by treating WCAG 2.1 AA and NENA conformance as launch gates) and data
migration (mitigate with a dry-run against a copy, reconciliation, and a
rollback plan). Risk: scope creep at the finish - mitigate by freezing scope to
launch-blockers and pushing extras to the backlog (Section 9).

---

## 5. Cross-sprint workstreams (continuous)

These run through every sprint, not just S7. They are budgeted into the
continuous-overhead reserve from Section 3.

- **Testing / CI (E14).** TDD throughout: failing test first, then code. Vitest
  for engine/unit logic; Playwright for end-to-end flows and screenshot capture.
  CI runs on every change; deploys go to `pathfinder.pages.dev`.
- **Accessibility (E12).** Not deferred to S7. Each sprint adds keyboard support
  and screen-reader labels to its new surface; S7 is the audit, VPAT, and
  non-visual map alternative, not the first time accessibility is considered.
- **Security / audit (E2, E11).** Server-side RBAC on every route from S1;
  audit logging of mutations from the start; no secrets and no real client data
  in the public repo, ever; periodic security review of new surface.
- **Documentation.** Living Markdown docs alongside code; ADRs for major
  decisions; AGENTS.md kept current; this sprint plan updated at each review to
  reflect actual progress (the roadmap shows progress).

---

## 6. Milestones and suggested timeline

Relative timeline only. Start is mid-June 2026; no calendar dates beyond that are
invented. Each sprint is two weeks.

| Milestone | Sprint(s) | Relative timing |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline documented (inherited) | S0 | Complete before start |
| Foundation live on CF, brand swap demo | S1 | Weeks 1-2 |
| Hierarchy and dashboards navigable | S2 | Weeks 3-4 |
| 2D engine ported, parity with v1 | S3 | Weeks 5-6 |
| Scan library and large-file upload | S4 | Weeks 7-8 |
| 3D splat viewer with measurement | S5 | Weeks 9-10 |
| Search and collaboration loop | S6 | Weeks 11-12 |
| Compliance, a11y, migration, launch | S7 | Weeks 13-14 |

Major checkpoints: end of S3 (core 2D value re-established in v2), end of S5
(3D differentiator demonstrable), end of S7 (procurement-grade launch).

---

## 7. Risk register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2D engine port regressions | Medium | High | Characterization tests written before refactor; pin PDF.js; do not re-litigate working canvas/print logic (de-risking principle); v1 vs v2 export diff | Engine lead |
| Splat performance on field devices | Medium | High | Target WebGL2 not WebGPU; ship SPZ (~90 percent smaller); Spark 2.0 streaming LOD; never serve raw PLY; device-profile perf check in S5 | 3D lead |
| Large-file upload reliability | Medium | Medium | R2 multipart with resumability; size validation; explicit interrupted-upload tests; storage-tier routing test | Backend lead |
| Compliance / accessibility gaps | Medium | High | WCAG 2.1 AA and NENA conformance as launch gates; per-sprint a11y; VPAT in S7; non-visual map alternatives; treat any single gap as procurement-disqualifying | Compliance/a11y lead |
| Scope creep | High | Medium | Fixed two-week sprints; scope frozen to in-scope stories; extras pushed to backlog; review/retro discipline; fewer clarifying detours | Delivery lead |
| Data migration (v1 -> v2) | Medium | High | Dry-run against a copy; row-count and FK reconciliation; zero-orphan check; rollback plan; migration rehearsed in S7 before cutover | Backend lead |
| Brand-token leakage (hard-coded color) | Low | Medium | Lint/test fails on literal hex in components; tokens-only rule from E1 | Frontend lead |
| Auth port divergence from v1 | Low | High | Port exact HS256/PBKDF2 parameters; test against known v1 tokens | Backend lead |

---

## 8. Backlog and future (post-S7)

Deliberately out of scope for S0-S7; sequenced after launch. Listed so reviewers
can see the trajectory without it inflating the committed plan.

- **RapidSOS integration.** Push maps and dispatchable-location data into PSAPs
  via the industry-standard clearinghouse; absence is disqualifying for the 911
  buyer, so this is the highest-priority post-launch item.
- **SSO / MFA.** Enterprise identity (SAML/OIDC SSO) and multi-factor auth;
  forward-looking in the canonical auth decision.
- **Runtime per-domain brand resolution.** Map a hostname to a brand profile at
  runtime (the forward-looking option beyond build-time `BRAND=` resolution).
- **Mobile responder app.** Native or PWA responder experience optimized for
  field use beyond the any-browser baseline.
- **CAD / E57 export.** Paid deliverable: export scans and maps to CAD and E57
  for cross-agency and facilities/insurance dual-use.
- **SOC 2 Type II / GovRAMP.** Pursue the certifications that gov/edu
  procurement increasingly requires (SOC 2 broadly; GovRAMP for government).

## 9. Revision history

| Version | Date | Author | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | 2026-06-15 | Pathfinder LiDAR Solutions | Initial draft; S0 documented as inherited baseline, S1-S7 planned forward build |
