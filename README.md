---

Pathfinder is a web portal where facility owners (schools, 911 centers, universities, government,
healthcare) and the teams that map them collaborate on emergency floorplans, place NFPA-standard
safety markers, and explore survey-grade 3D scans of the building - mp4 walkthroughs plus interactive
Gaussian-splat scenes captured with FJD Trion LiDAR. It exports responder-ready printed maps and
NG911-aligned data.

It is a ground-up SvelteKit rewrite of the original ELS911 portal that keeps the battle-tested 2D
annotation and NFPA map-export engines and adds 3D scans, a multi-school hierarchy, collaboration,
global search, and a drop-in white-label brand layer. The market gap it targets: incumbents
(CRG, Navigate360, Raptor) ship verified 2D plans and 360-degree photos; Pathfinder makes a true
measurable 3D digital twin the primary artifact.

## Screenshots

The portal as built, captured by the Playwright suite (`npm run test:e2e`) and stored in
[`tests/e2e/__screenshots__/`](./tests/e2e/__screenshots__/) - regenerated on every test run.

<summary>Personas</summary>

- **Operator admin** - runs a Pathfinder deployment under its own brand (Pathfinder LiDAR, ELS911, a reseller).
- **Mapping staff** - uploads plans/scans, places markers, runs reviews.
- **District safety director / client** - reviews maps for their facilities, comments, approves.
- **First responder (read-only)** - finds what they need inside a building before they arrive.

## Architecture

Shell rewrite, engine port: the app shell is SvelteKit; the proven imperative engines (2D annotation,
map/NFPA export) and the new 3D splat viewer are framework-agnostic modules mounted into thin
components - modernized structure without re-litigating logic that already works.

```
Browser (SvelteKit + Svelte 5)
  routes/  +page.svelte  ............ UI, brand-tokenized (var(--brand-*))
  lib/engines/ 2d-annotate | map-export | splat-viewer (mounted modules)
        |
  hooks.server.ts  ................. auth context, route guards, security headers
        |
  routes/api/**/+server.ts  ........ API (replaces v1 Pages Functions catch-all)
        |
Cloudflare
  D1 (DB) ........ SQLite: users, hierarchy, projects, annotations, media, audit
  R2 (DOCUMENTS) . PDFs, point clouds, SPZ splats, mp4 walkthroughs (cold archive for masters)
  KV (CACHE) ..... sessions, rate-limit counters
```

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | SvelteKit (Svelte 5) + `@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare` |
| Database | Cloudflare D1 (SQLite), parameterized queries, migrations in `migrations/` |
| Storage | Cloudflare R2 (SPZ splats delivered; master PLY archived cold, never served) |
| Cache / sessions | Cloudflare KV |
| 2D | PDF.js (pinned) | 
| 3D | Spark (THREE.js, WebGL2), SPZ format |
| Auth | JWT HS256 (Web Crypto) + PBKDF2-SHA256 passwords + API keys |
| Tests | Vitest (unit) + Playwright (e2e, screenshots) |
| Deploy | `wrangler pages deploy` (direct) |

([PDF](./docs/pdf/Pathfinder-Specification.pdf)).

## 3D scans

The pipeline is **FJD Trion P1 scanner -> Trion Model (Gaussian splatting + mp4) -> SPZ**.

- **mp4 walkthrough** plays everywhere, zero friction - the responder baseline.
- **Interactive splat viewer** (Spark, WebGL2, 98%+ device support) appears when a splat asset exists,
  with orbit/fly/walk, point-to-point **measurement**, **3D-anchored markers** (exits, hazards, AED),
  **floor switching**, named **viewpoints**, and **version compare**.
- **SPZ** is the delivery format: ~90% smaller than PLY, mobile-safe; master PLY is archived in cold
  R2 and never served to clients.

Why this matters for responders, and the library/format analysis: [research/03](./docs/research/03-3d-splat-viewer.md).

## Security and compliance

Facility safety maps are sensitive-but-unclassified - a blueprint of exits, shutoffs, and chokepoints
is itself a risk if leaked. The code is public; **secrets and real facility data never are**.

- **Auth hardening (shipped, audited):** PBKDF2-SHA256 (100k iters) with constant-time comparison,
  HS256 JWT with pinned alg and fail-closed secret, httpOnly/Secure/SameSite cookies, 12h token TTL
  with token-version revocation, KV-backed login rate limiting/lockout, anti-enumeration decoy hashing,
  input caps, and security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, nosniff). Every data route enforces
  authorization server-side; clients cannot see other orgs' data.
- **Standards the product targets:** NFPA 170 symbols, NFPA 3000 pre-incident planning, Alyssa's Law
  mapping mandates, NG911/NENA z-axis floor labeling, FERPA "school official" DPA, immutable audit logs,
  **WCAG 2.1 AA** (ADA Title II). Any one gap can disqualify a gov/edu bid.

Background and requirement implications: [research/02](./docs/research/02-compliance-standards.md).
Reporting a vulnerability: see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

## White-label in one step

The brand layer (`src/lib/brand/`) is the single source of truth. To rebrand:

1. Add a profile: `src/lib/brand/profiles/<id>.ts` (name, logo, colors, fonts, contact, legal).
2. Set `VITE_BRAND=<id>`.

No component edits - every component reads `var(--brand-*)` tokens. Ships with the **Pathfinder**
(default) and **ELS911** profiles.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:5173

# Cloudflare D1 (local) - migrate + seed a dev admin
npm run db:migrate:local
npm run db:seed:local       # creates test@test.com / test1234 (admin)
npm run db:seed:hierarchy:local

npm run check          # svelte-check (type/diagnostics)
npm run test:unit      # Vitest
npm run test:e2e       # Playwright (captures screenshots)
npm run build
npm run deploy         # wrangler pages deploy (direct)
```

Secrets (`JWT_SECRET`, etc.) live in `.dev.vars` locally (gitignored) and Cloudflare secrets in
production. The app fails closed if a real `JWT_SECRET` is not set in production.

## Testing (TDD)

Pathfinder is **test-first**. Every acceptance criterion in
[`docs/03-acceptance-criteria.md`](./docs/03-acceptance-criteria.md) maps to a test; user-visible
behavior is verified with Playwright screenshots committed to the repo. Current suite:
**164 unit + 45 e2e passing**. The mapping from criteria to test-writing prompts is the
[TDD Plan](./docs/04-tdd-plan.md) ([PDF](./docs/pdf/Pathfinder-TDD-Plan.pdf)). Rules every
contributor (human or AI) follows: [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md).

## Roadmap

An aggressive one-week delivery, Monday to Monday. S0 is the inherited v1 baseline; scope per
sprint is unchanged from the full plan, only compressed in time.

| Day | Sprint | Theme | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| (before) | S0 | Inherited v1 engines + schema baseline | Complete (inherited) |
| Monday | S1 | Foundation: scaffold, brand layer, auth, test harness | Complete |
| Tuesday | S2 | Org hierarchy + roll-up dashboards | Complete |
| Wednesday | S3 | Engine port: 2D annotation + map/NFPA export | Complete |
| Thursday | S4 | Unified scan library + R2 multipart upload | Complete |
| Friday | S5 | 3D viewer: mp4 + Spark splat + measurement + 3D markers | Complete |
| Saturday | S6 | Global search + batch export + collaboration | Complete |
| Sunday | S7 | Compliance, accessibility, migration, launch | Complete |
| (next) Monday | - | Launch / handoff | Complete (deployed) |

## Project status

S0 (inherited v1 engines) baseline; **S1 (auth, hardened) and S2 (hierarchy + dashboards) complete**,
deployed to the test project at [pathfinder-c3o.pages.dev](https://pathfinder-c3o.pages.dev). 50 unit +
6 e2e tests green. Remaining sprints port the 2D engine, add the scan library, 3D splat viewer, search,
collaboration, and compliance.
